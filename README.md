## Project Goal
The goal of our project is to analyze the yearly and monthly electricity demand for the State of Texas during 2019-2020. We plan to fit a time series model to our data and use the model to forecast energy demand. We will use the R programming language to explore our data, analyze the time series, and build our model. Our data is sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/)

## Data Analysis
The data is read from a .csv file and contains two columns. The first column is the Time period (in hourly increments) and the second column is the Energy demanded (in Mega Watt Hours). The time frame under consideration for our primarily analysis begins June 01, 2019 and ends May 31, 2020. We will explore the following attributes in energy consumption: trends across time (monthly, weekly and daily), correlation, seasonality, and variability.
